Resources for teaching Pearson's Interactive Science - Earth Science book

These resources were put together for my a middle school science class. Taught in a catholic school, so there are some religious references which address why scientific reasoning does not conflict with our faith.

They are orgainized in relation to the sections of Pearson's Interactive Science - Earth Science textbook, 2013 edition.
