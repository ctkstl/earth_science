1.  Introducing Earth
    1.  The Earth System
    2.  Earth's Interior
        *   [Under pressure simulation](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/under-pressure)
        *   Magnetic field strength with two magnets on string - Show that one magnet will align with the earth's field... Then use another magnet to show how close it has to be to 'overpower' the earth's field.
        *   The above doesn't seem to work well. Instead, use a compass and show how close a strong magnet needs to get to affect it. You can feel the affect of the compass on the magnet!
        *   Magnetic field doesn't always point north. [Here's the map of it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:World_Magnetic_Declination_2010.pdf). Why? 1) The magnetic poles don't match the astrophysical poles of the planet. 2) There are anamolies in the mantle (and core?) that cause variations in it, the largest called the "South Atlantic Anomoly".
    3.  Convection and the Mantle
    4.  Exploring Earth’s Surface
        *   [Map of Ozark Plateau/Mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozarks#/media/File:OzarkRelief.jpg), and how it comes right up into STL.
            *   Turn on 'Terrain' feature of google maps and zoom around south-west of STL
    5.  Models of Earth
        *   Use tablet starmap to find the direction to the north star...compare the direction to our location on a globe. 
        *   More complicated: Find the direction to the sun, compare with time of day + day of year...how does this change by latitude. 
    6.  Topographic Maps
        *   Compare a topo map of somewhere (with elevation) with the Google Earth fly around of that location.
        *   Using [Taum Sauk Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taum_Sauk_Mountain) (Highest Point in MO) as an example
            *   Go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.5719819,-90.7286916,18z), the highest point is where the gray trail ends. In the menu select 'Terrain' view.
            *   Go to a topo map source, such as [MyTopo](http://www.mytopo.com/maps/). Then search for "Taum Sauk Mountain, Arcadia, MO, United States" (start typing and it should auto-complete for you. 
            *   Another source for topo maps is the [USGS Site](http://store.usgs.gov/b2c_usgs/usgs/maplocator/%28ctype=areaDetails&xcm=r3standardpitrex_prd&carea=$ROOT&layout=6_1_61_48&uiarea=2%29/.do). Here search for "Taum Sauk Mountain", it should put a push pin on the top of the mountain. Click on it and select the "Ironton 7.5x7.5 GRID from 2000" and click the 16.06MB link to download it. [This link](http://ims.er.usgs.gov/gda_services/download?item_id=5578410) may also work for you.
            *   Open google earth and search for "Taum Sauk Mountain Overlook". From here, the high-point should be about 450m West-Southwest of the overlook point. You can also search for Mina Sauk Falls (the highest waterfall in MO). Use the google earth controls to change the perspective so you can zoom around the mountain sideways.
            *   What is the top of the mountain like...a peak? flat? (A: Very flat...when standing at the high-point, you cannot see any substantial change in elevation around you.)
            *   Bonus: About [6 miles west-southwest](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Taum+Sauk+Mountain+State+Park/@37.5336428,-90.8280411,6285m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x87d9c60a8d53d03b:0xd5afdee463133db2!6m1!1e1) of Taum Sauk Mountain is the [Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taum_Sauk_Hydroelectric_Power_Station) where the electric company built a large reservoir on top of a mountain. Each night (when electricity is cheap) they pump water up into it, then each day they let the water drain out of it (producing electricity), effectively working as a giant battery. Unfortunately in 2005, due to a sensor failure, there was a [major accident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taum_Sauk_Hydroelectric_Power_Station#Upper_reservoir_failure) where the water overflowed the lake, and washed out the side causing all the water in the lake to spill down the side of the mountain. It formed a ["scour"](https://footprintmag.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/scour.jpg) where a huge channel was cut in the mountainside, stripping off all the dirt, all the way down to the bedrock, hundreds of feet across and up to fifty feet deep. On google earth, you can see it coming out of the north-east side of the upper reservoir, and running down-hill into Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park.
